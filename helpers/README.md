# Starfish ./helpers

The helpers are common components to most websites. In Starfish they may consist of PHP, HTML, CSS or even javascript code.

## Directory structure conventions

1. The *main folder* ( ./helpers/<main folder>/ ) is the name of the helper itself;
2. The helper may contain a language file, which will be named after the language abreviation (e.g. "en", "ro" etc.) and stored in the ./helpers/<main folder>/language/.
